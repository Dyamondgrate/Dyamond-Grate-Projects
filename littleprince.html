<p class="Paragraph">
    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.<u> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrving a very fragile treasure.</u> <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even. that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes. his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="redtext">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class="redtext">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a hower -the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the Name of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
